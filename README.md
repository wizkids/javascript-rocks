# JavaScript rocks!

Welcome to the Wizkids JavaScript test!
The test is inspired by one of our products (AppWriter) which helps people with read/writing troubles by enabling them to read text out load and get word suggestions (predictions) while typing.

Predictions are word completions based on the input text, for example:
If the input text is `I like ca` the predictions could be `cars`, `cats` and `cake`.

The test requires you to write a small web page and JavaScript that implements a small subset of AppWriter functionality. You are free to choose any library&ast; to help you or write vanilla HTML/CSS/JS if that's your thing!

If you have any issues getting the word prediction web service to work, don't hesitate in contacting us.

&ast; *Except autocomplete modules such as jQuery/Angular/React autocomplete - we would like to see your ability to solve this rather than your ability to use third party modules.*

## Scope

We expect a simply structured HTML/CSS/JS project with good readability. Design and UX is not a major consideration - keeping it simple is fine.

We expect a well-versed front-ender to be able to complete the task within 1 hour.

## Tasks

#### 1.  Write a function that performs a web request to fetch word predictions.
See the "Word predictions web service description" section below for more info on how to use the web service.

#### 2. Display the first 10 word predictions in HTML.

#### 3. Add a `<textarea>` in your HTML and use the text value for the function you wrote in step #1.
The text should be based on the position of the caret inside the textarea, for example:
```
Hello, my name is J|ohn Doe and I like pie! 
```
The extracted text should be from the start of the `<textarea>` up to the caret, which in this example would be `Hello, my name is J`.
The list of word predictions should be updated on either `keyup` or  `keypress` (whichever you think is more appropriate).

#### 4. Make your word predictions result clickable and insert the clicked prediction into the `<textarea>` on click.
The word prediction should be inserted into the `<textarea>` at the location of the caret.

#### 5. (OPTIONAL) Emphasize the part of each word prediction that has already been written.
For example, using the text from step #3 `Hello, my name is J` the letter `J` should be emphasized in the predictions `John`, `James` and `June`:

> **J**ohn  
> **J**ames  
> **J**une  

#### 6. Add your code in a Git project on GitHub and share the link with your Wizkids contact.

#### 7. (OPTIONAL, but strongly recommended) Share your most awesome JavaScript front-end project with us that you've had a major and contribution to.
